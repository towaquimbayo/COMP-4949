147	148	3890	Too clumsy in key moments... to make a big splash.	1
148	149	3905	"Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them, Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and'60s, the movie is a silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp through horror and hellish conditions."	2

160	161	4235	The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head.	1

171	172	4539	It's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects.	3
172	173	4550	"Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times, and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste."	2

180	181	4729	"The punch lines that miss, unfortunately, outnumber the hits by three-to-one."	1
181	182	4749	"Like Smoke Signals, the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama"	3
182	183	4783	Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made Mamet's `` House of Games'' and last fall's `` Heist'' so much fun.	3
183	184	4813	"The film aims to be funny, uplifting and moving, sometimes all at once."	3
184	185	4828	"At a brief 42 minutes, we need more X and less blab."	2
185	186	4846	The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy.	2

187	188	4872	Uneven but a lot of fun.	3
188	189	4878	The result might look like Vulgar.	2

196	197	5030	"If you saw it on TV, you'd probably turn it off, convinced that you had already seen that movie."	1
197	198	5056	You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools.	1
198	199	5097	This is a superior horror flick.	4
199	200	5104	The movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness.	2
200	201	5121	A little weak -- and it is n't that funny.	1

206	207	5210	It's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Indian film culture that allows Americans to finally revel in its splendor.	4
207	208	5240	Well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process.	3
208	209	5267	"... only Bond can save us from the latest eccentric, super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction."	2
209	210	5294	"It is depressing, ruthlessly pained and depraved, the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound."	0
210	211	5318	Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as -LRB- Jason Bourne -RRB-.	3
211	212	5337	Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance.	1
212	213	5347	"When it's this rich and luscious, who cares ?"	3
213	214	5360	A singularly off-putting romantic comedy.	1
214	215	5367	Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through.	2
215	216	5399	"Would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story, and left off the film's predictable denouement."	0
216	217	5429	"A superfluous sequel... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let's get this thing over with' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place, but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find."	1
217	218	5480	"An earnest, roughshod document, it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history, and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool."	3
218	219	5517	Cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation -LRB- career - kids = misery -RRB- in tiresome romantic-comedy duds.	1
219	220	5542	A film that plays things so nice'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen.	1
220	221	5569	His work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories.	3
221	222	5584	"An even more predictable, cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor."	1
222	223	5597	Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV's Dawson's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story.	0
223	224	5627	"The script covers huge, heavy topics in a bland, surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why, for instance, good things happen to bad people."	1
224	225	5665	The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen.	0
225	226	5683	They threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans.	1
226	227	5717	"It's difficult to imagine that a more confused, less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002."	0
227	228	5749	"Though the film is well-intentioned, one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable."	3
228	229	5768	"Jolting into Charleston rhythms, the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -LRB- accurate ?"	2
229	230	5796	Or both.	2
230	231	5798	"Williams plays Sy, another of his open-faced, smiling madmen, like the killer in Insomnia."	2
231	232	5821	Phoned-in business as usual.	1
232	233	5827	"With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action, All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s."	1
233	234	5857	"Ah, yes, that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze."	0
234	235	5877	"Thoughtless, random, superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents"	0
235	236	5894	"In an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure, Narc strikes a defiantly retro chord, and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve."	3
236	237	5935	A rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest.	3
237	238	5953	... a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind.	4
238	239	5964	Miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers.	4
239	240	5982	"A chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president, but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten, cynical journalists into what was essentially, by campaign's end, an extended publicity department."	3
240	241	6037	"Provides the kind of ` laugh therapy' I need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor, amusing characters, and a happy ending."	4
241	242	6067	Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core.	0
242	243	6077	"At a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism American moviemaking ever had, Godfrey Reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon."	3
243	244	6112	Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff.	2
244	245	6143	Robert Harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows.	3
245	246	6180	"This movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen, but it's the work of an artist, one whose view of America, history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep."	4
246	247	6221	Feral and uncomfortable.	1
247	248	6226	"Sillier, cuter, and shorter than the first -LRB- as best I remember -RRB-, but still a very good time at the cinema."	4
248	249	6254	"It's more enjoyable than I expected, though, and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs."	3
249	250	6282	Black-and-white and unrealistic.	0
250	251	6287	The film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol.	3
251	252	6305	"The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public, to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers."	0
252	253	6352	"Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous, pervasive, and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense."	3
253	254	6391	"Some of the computer animation is handsome, and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale, but overall the film never rises above mediocrity."	1
254	255	6431	Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere.	4
255	256	6449	"A breezy blend of art, history, esoteric musings and philosophy."	3
256	257	6465	"Now as a former Gong Show addict, I'll admit it, my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show."	3
257	258	6503	Genuinely unnerving.	3
258	259	6507	"The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking, sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history."	4
259	260	6536	One of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature.	3
260	261	6557	A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present.	2
261	262	6593	"Halfway through the movie, the humor dwindles."	1
262	263	6602	"Witty and often surprising, a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy."	4
263	264	6620	"One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers, and circles it obsessively, without making contact."	1
264	265	6660	"In fact, even better."	3
265	266	6666	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet.	2
266	267	6684	Proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie.	2
267	268	6701	"An uplifting, largely bogus story."	2
268	269	6708	"Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances, the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods."	4
269	270	6738	Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen.	4
270	271	6766	A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last.	4
271	272	6779	"After the first 10 minutes, which is worth seeing"	3
272	273	6795	It has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past.	1
273	274	6813	"Screenwriter Chris ver Weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull, but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability."	2
274	275	6847	"Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz's social critique, casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries."	1
275	276	6886	"Ultimately, Sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic, and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness."	1
276	277	6930	"The jokes are flat, and the action looks fake."	0
277	278	6942	A mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book.	2
278	279	6956	Festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you.	0
279	280	6981	"In addition to the overcooked, ham-fisted direction, which has all the actors reaching for the back row, the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry."	0
280	281	7014	"A vile, incoherent mess... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg's brilliant ` Videodrome.'"	0
281	282	7037	"First, for a movie that tries to be smart, it's kinda dumb."	1
282	283	7053	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD.	2
283	284	7067	... silly humbuggery...	1
284	285	7071	"Is n't as sharp as the original... Despite some visual virtues, ` Blade II' just does n't cut it."	1
285	286	7092	"A smart, arch and rather cold-blooded comedy."	3
286	287	7102	#NAME?	0
287	288	7109	"Its flame-like, roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude."	3
288	289	7123	Robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates.	4
289	290	7141	A slight but sweet film.	3
290	291	7146	Got a David Lynch jones ?	2
291	292	7153	Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock.	2
292	293	7163	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation.	1
293	294	7213	`` Austin Powers in Goldmember'' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end.	4
294	295	7242	What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears' first movie.	2
295	296	7262	The filmmakers might want to look it up.	2
296	297	7269	"While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity, this sad, occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman's warmest."	4
297	298	7298	There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country.	4
298	299	7323	A dreary movie.	0
299	300	7327	"Sadly, though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear, they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction."	1
300	301	7369	"To the filmmakers, Ivan is a prince of a fellow, but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited, and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit."	1
301	302	7422	"Using a stock plot, About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater."	3
302	303	7452	"Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game, this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness."	3
303	304	7500	What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters.	3
304	305	7524	Buy popcorn.	2
